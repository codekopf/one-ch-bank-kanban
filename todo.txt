+ Add readme.md to root
+ Add logging service
+ + Logging service only available in dev mode
+ Add tests
+ Maybe rework solution to originally intended design (kanban-card component)
+ Copilot suggestion > use Angular 15.2.1, Spring Boot 2.5.4., Docker to run the application, use GitHub Actions to build and deploy the application to Heroku.
+ Rework my image of my implementation in readme.md to GIF. Scale it proportionally to the width of the readme.md file.
